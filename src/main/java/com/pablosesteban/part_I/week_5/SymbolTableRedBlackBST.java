BALANCED BST:
    have near-perfect balance:
        every path from root to null link has same length
    
    the height is guaranteed to be no larger than 2 logN

    2-3 Search Trees:
        a pretty old algorithm which allow the nodes in our trees to hold more than one key
        
        is a way to generalize BST to provide the flexibility that we need to guarantee fast performance in all operations in a Symbol Table
        
        two properties which have to be maintained (invariants):
            perfect balance

            symmetric order: inorder traversal yields keys in ascending order

        two kind of nodes:
            2-node: one key, two children (less and greater)
            
            3-node: two keys, three children (less, between and greater)

        inserting a new key into a 3-node:
            1) compares the new key with the those on the 3-node (creates a temporary 4-node)
            
            2) choose the middle key (split it into a 3-node)

            3) put the middle key into the parent

            4) repeat those steps every time the parent is a 3-node

        the only time the height of a 2-3 tree changes is when the roots splits, i.e. all node in the path are 3-nodes

        the process of inserting a new key into a 3-node involves a CONSTANT number of operation, i.e. change a constant number of links

        guaranteed logarithmic performance for all operations

/*
RED-BLACK BST (Left-Leaning):
    is a simple data structure that allows us to implement 2-3 search tree
    
    represent a 2â€“3 search tree as a BST using an internal left-leaning "red" links for representing a 3-node
    
    the larger of the two nodes in the 3-node will always be the root of a little BST of size two for the 2-node
    
    the link between the two nodes, the LEFT link that links the larger key to the smaller one we'll color RED
    
    properties:
        no node has two red links connected to it
            
        every path from root to null link has the same number of black links
        
        red links lean LEFT

        there is one-to-one correspondence between 2-3 Search Trees and Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees (horizontal red links):
            all of the operations that we're going to look at for red-black trees can be understood in terms of the corresponding operations on 2-3 search trees
    
    as red links are "internal" thing, methods from elementary BST will work here without reimplementing, and work better because of the perfect balanced tree
