 * An Abstract Data Type (ADT) which defines the fundamental graph operations.
 * A graph is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that each connect a
 * pair of vertices. When there is an edge connecting two vertices, we say that
 * the vertices are adjacent to one another and that the edge is incident to 
 * both vertices. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.
 * A subgraph is a subset of a graph’s edges and associated vertices that
 * constitutes a graph.
