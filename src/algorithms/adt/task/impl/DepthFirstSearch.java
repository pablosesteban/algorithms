/**
 * A fundamental recursive implementation that follows the graphâ€™s edges to find
 * the vertices connected to the source vertex provided to the constructor.
 * It maintains an array of boolean values to mark all of the vertices that are 
 * connected to the source.
 * Depth First Search (DFS) approach to search a graph follows paths from the
 * source vertex to other vertices in the graph, marking each vertex encountered
 * by invoking a recursive method that visits vertices and mark them as having
 * been visited and visit (recursively) all the vertices that are adjacent to it
 * and that have not yet been marked.
 * DFS marks all the vertices connected to a given source in time proportional
 * to the sum of their degrees because marking ensures that each vertex is
 * visited once (taking time proportional to its degree to check marks).
