/**
 * Depth First Search (DFS) is a recursive implementation that follows the
 * graphâ€™s edges to find all the vertices connected to a source vertex giving
 * from each one a path to source.
 * This approach to search a graph follows paths from the source vertex to other
 * vertices in the graph, marking each vertex encountered by invoking a
 * recursive method that visits vertices and mark them as having been visited
 * and visit (recursively) all the vertices that are adjacent to it and that
 * have not yet been marked.
 * Marks all the vertices connected to a given source in time proportional to
 * the sum of their degrees because marking ensures that each vertex is visited
 * once (taking time proportional to its degree to check marks).
 * It maintains an array of boolean values to mark all of the vertices that are
 * connected to the source and another array of integer values that gives a way
 * to find a path back to source vertex provided to the constructor for every
 * vertex connected to it in the graph.
 * It remembers a path from each vertex to the source, such that integer[w] = v
 * means that v-w was the edge used to access w for the first time.
 * The implementation choose the path based on the order of the adjacency list
 * of each vertex. The path depend not just on the graph, but also on the
 * representation and the nature of the recursion (a pushdown stack (LIFO) that
 * is managed by the system to support the recursive search method), such that,
 * it choose of the edges yet to be explored, the one that was most recently
 * encountered (explores the vertices farthest from the source vertex first).
 * Provides a way to search a path from a given source vertex to any marked
 * vertex in time proportional its length, as the array of integer values is a
 * parent-link representation of a tree rooted at source vertex that contains
 * all the vertices connected to it, defining the paths (not the shortest) from
 * source to every vertex that is connected to it.
 * DFS explores the graph by looking for new vertices far away from the start
 * point, taking closer vertices only when dead ends are encountered, so DFS
 * paths tend to be long and winding.
