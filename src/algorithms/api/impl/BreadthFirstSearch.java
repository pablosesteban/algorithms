/**
 * Breadth First Search (BFS) is a non-recursive implementation that follows the
 * graphâ€™s edges to find all the vertices connected to a source vertex giving
 * from each one the shortest path to source.
 * This approach to search a graph follows paths from the source vertex to other
 * vertices in the graph, marking each vertex encountered by maintaining a queue
 * with all vertices to visit, which have not yet been marked, and mark them as
 * having been visited and removing them from the queue.
 * Marks all the vertices connected to a given source in time proportional to
 * the sum of their degrees because marking ensures that each vertex is visited
 * once (taking time proportional to its degree to check marks).
 * It maintains an array of boolean values to mark all of the vertices that are
 * connected to the source and another array of integer values that gives a way
 * to find a path back to source vertex provided to the constructor for every
 * vertex connected to it in the graph.
 * It uses a Queue (FIFO), such that, it choose of the edges yet to be explored,
 * the one that was least recently encountered (explores the vertices closest
 * from the source vertex first) to find paths in a graph with the fewest number
 * of edges from the source to each connected vertex.
 * Provides a way to search a path from a given source vertex to any marked
 * vertex in time proportional its length, as the array of integer values is a
 * parent-link representation of a tree rooted at source vertex that contains
 * all the vertices connected to it, defining the shortest paths from source to
 * every vertex that is connected to it.
 * BFS completely covers the area close to the starting point, moving farther
 * away only when everything nearby has been examined, so BFS paths are short
 * and direct.
